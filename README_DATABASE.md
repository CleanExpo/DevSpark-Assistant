# Database Integration in DevSpark Assistant

## Overview

DevSpark Assistant now includes advanced database integration capabilities that allow you to scaffold complex applications with proper data persistence layers. The system currently supports:

- **Python/Flask with SQLAlchemy**: Full ORM setup with models, migrations, and service layer
- **Node.js/Express with MongoDB**: Mongoose schema integration with complete CRUD operations

## How to Use Database Integration

### Quick Start

To scaffold a project with database integration, use the `init` command with the `--ai` flag and a description of your database needs:

#### Flask/SQLAlchemy Example:

```bash
python -m devspark.cli init --name MyFlaskApp --template python_flask_api --ai --desc "Add SQLAlchemy with a User model having username, email, and password fields. Include migrations." --resource "user"
```

#### Node.js/MongoDB Example:

```bash
python -m devspark.cli init --name MyNodeApp --template nodejs_express_api --ai --desc "Add MongoDB with a Product model having name, price, and description fields." --main-resource "product"
```

### Key Features

- **Auto-Detection**: The system automatically detects database-related requests in your description
- **Ecosystem-Specific Best Practices**: Implementations follow standard patterns for each framework
- **Complete Setup**: Includes model definitions, service layer, configurations, and environment variables
- **Migration Support**: Adds Flask-Migrate for SQLAlchemy migrations
- **Error Handling**: Implements proper error handling for database operations

## Documentation

For more detailed information, please refer to:

- [DATABASE_INTEGRATION.md](DATABASE_INTEGRATION.md): Complete documentation of the database integration capabilities
- [LIVE_TESTING.md](LIVE_TESTING.md): Instructions for testing with live LLM calls

## Testing

The database integration features include comprehensive tests:

1. **Mock Tests**: 
   - `test_flask_sqlalchemy_integration()` in test_ai_flask_customization.py
   - `test_express_mongodb_integration()` in test_nodejs_express_customization.py

2. **Combined Tests**:
   - `test_database_integrations.py` for testing both integrations together

To run the tests with mock LLM responses:

```bash
python test_database_integrations.py
```

## Future Plans

Future versions will expand database integration to include:
- Additional database types (PostgreSQL with TypeORM, MongoDB with MongoEngine)
- More advanced features (relationships, validation, authentication)
- Enhanced code generation (seeders, migrations, transactions)

## Contributing

To contribute to the database integration capabilities:
1. Examine the enhanced prompting in `devspark/core/llm_interface.py`
2. Test with different customization descriptions
3. Submit PRs with improvements to the prompt engineering or mock implementations
