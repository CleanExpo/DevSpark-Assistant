- Cross-platform shell command handling
- Virtual environment management
- Development tool configuration
- Git hooks setup and management

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools Integration
- Automated setup of common development tools:
  - Code formatting (Black)
  - Linting (Flake8)
  - Type checking (MyPy)
  - Import sorting (isort)
  - Testing (pytest)
  - Code coverage tracking
  - Pre-commit hooks

### üîÑ Configuration Management
- Smart configuration handling
- Environment-specific settings
- Merge capability for existing configurations
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Installation

```bash
pip install devspark-assistant
```

## Quick Start

1. Initialize a new project:
```bash
devspark init
```

2. Set up development environment:
```python
from devspark.utils.dev_rules import dev_rules

# Setup development environment
dev_rules.setup_dev_environment("/path/to/project")

# Install development dependencies
dev_rules.install_dev_dependencies("/path/to/project")

# Setup development tools
dev_rules.setup_dev_tools("/path/to/project")
```

## Development Environment Features

### Virtual Environment Management
```python
# Create or recreate virtual environment
dev_rules.setup_dev_environment(
    project_path="/path/to/project",
    force_recreate=True  # Optional: recreate if exists
)
```

### Development Tools Configuration
```python
# Setup development tools with existing config merge
dev_rules.setup_dev_tools(
    project_path="/path/to/project",
    merge_existing=True  # Preserves existing configurations
)
```

### Git Hooks Setup
```python
# Setup Git hooks for consistent code quality
dev_rules.setup_git_hooks("/path/to/project")
```

### Development Configuration
```python
# Create or update development configuration
config = {
    "development_mode": True,
    "debug_level": "DEBUG",
    "custom_setting": "value"
}
dev_rules.create_dev_config(
    project_path="/path/to/project",
    config=config,
    merge_existing=True  # Merges with existing config
)
```

## Cross-Platform Shell Support

DevSpark Assistant provides consistent command execution across different shells:

- PowerShell
- CMD
- Bash
- Other Unix shells

Example of cross-platform command execution:
```python
from devspark.utils.shell_helper import shell

# Execute commands consistently across platforms
shell.execute_command("your_command")

# Join multiple commands
commands = ["cd /path", "git init", "git add ."]
shell.join_commands(commands)
```
